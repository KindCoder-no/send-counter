# Guess the number abuser

This is a python script that you can use to abuse "guess the number" games on discord

## 📝 Install/Run

``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``

Run the script by typing ``py counter.py``

## Usage
You need to have the discord channel open, so that the bot can type and send the messages

As you see in the image it ask you for a ``Start number``, ``Stop number`` and ``wait``.
The wait function is how many seconds the bot should wait between sending each message, this is due to the Discord rate limit

## Disclaimer
This is just for fun, and i don't recommend you use it in a public Discord server
